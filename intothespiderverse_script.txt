Peter Parker / Spider-Man [narrating]: Alright, let's do this one last time. My name is Peter Parker. I was bitten by a radioactive spider, And for ten years, I've been the one and only Spider-Man. I’m pretty sure you know the rest.
Ben Parker: With great power, comes great responsibility.
Peter Parker [narrating]: I saved a bunch of people, fell in love, saved the city, and then I saved the city again, and again and again, and again. And I did, uh... I did this. [cuts to Peter doing the dance from Spider-Man 3] We don’t really talk about this. Look, I'm a comic book, I'm a cereal, did a Christmas album. I have an excellent theme song.
TV show: Spider-Man, Spider-Man...
Peter Parker [narrating]: And a... a so-so popsicle. I mean, I've looked worse. But after everything, I still love being Spider-Man. I mean, who wouldn't? So no matter how many hits I take, I always find a way to come back. Because the only thing standing between this city and oblivion is me. There's only one Spider-Man, and you're looking at him.
Ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh Needless to say... Nevertheless Callin' it quits - Now, baby, I'm a wreck - RIO: Miles! Miles, pap, time for school! Miles! Miles! - Miles! - Yeah! Yeah? Are you finished packing for school? Yeah. Just ironing my last shirt. You're a sunflower... Come on! You a grown man now. - Let's show these teachers that. - Miles! Where's my laptop? If you want me to drive you, we gotta go now. No, Dad, I'll walk. - Personal chauffeur going once. - It's okay. - Miles! Gotta go. - In a minute! - Gotta go. - In a minute! Mom, I gotta go. In a minute. See you Friday. Look who's back. Yo, what's going on, bro? Hey, I'm just walking by. How you doin'? Yo, Miles! You feel that earthquake last night? What you talkin' about? I slept like a baby last night. - How's that new school? - So easy. - We miss you, Miles. - You miss me? I still live here! Wait, you miss me? Contra! Oh, come on. Seriously, Dad. Walking would've been fine. You can walk plenty on Saturday when you peel those stickers off. You saw that? I don't know if that was me. And the two from yesterday on Clinton. Yeah, those were me. Look at that. Another new coffee shop. - You see that? - Totally. Yeah. - What's that one called? - Foam Party. "Foam Party"? Come on. And everyone is just linin' up. You see that? I see it. Is that a coffee shop or a disco? Dad, you're old, man. There are multiple reports of another mysterious seismic event last night. Sources close to Spider-Man say he's looking into the problem. Spider-Man. I mean, this guy swings in once a day, zip-zap-zop in his little mask and answers to no one. Right? Yeah, Dad. Yeah. Meanwhile, my guys are out there, - lives on the line, no masks. - Uh-huh. - We show our faces. - Speed up. I know these kids. With great ability comes great accountability. That's not even how the saying goes. I do like his cereal, though. I'll give him that. Oh, my gosh. Don't cops run red lights? Oh, yeah, some do. But not your dad. My memories keep begging For someone else I know this feeling, yes I know it very well Why can't I go back to Brooklyn Middle? You've given it two weeks. We're not having this conversation. I just think that this new school is elitist. - "Elitist"? - And I would prefer to be at a normal school among the people. "The people"? These are your people. I'm only here 'cause I won that stupid lottery. No way. You passed the entry test just like everybody else. You have an opportunity here. You wanna blow that? You wanna end up like your uncle? What's wrong with Uncle Aaron? He's a good guy. We all make choices in life. It doesn't feel like I have a choice right now. You don't! I love you, Miles. Yeah, I know, Dad. See you Friday. - You gotta say "I love you" back. - Dad, are you serious? I wanna hear it. "I love you, Dad." You wanna hear me say it? You're dropping me off at a school. - "I love you, Dad." - Look at this place. "Dad, I love you." Dad, I love you. That's a copy. Tie your shoes, please. "I love you, Dad." Hey, good morning. How you doin'? - Weekend was short, huh? - "That's a copy." Oh, my gosh! This is embarrassing. We wore the same jacket. Hey. Your shoe's untied. Yeah, I'm aware. It's a choice. Theory is that All matter is composed Of at least three Fundamental particles Who can solve this for XY? And that is known as a syllogism. Read two chapters of Great Expectations. A take-home quiz on volumetric pressure. Five-page essay with your conclusions stressed. ...countless other possibilities. There could be a universe where I am wearing red. Or wearing leather pants. Mr. Morales. Movin' in the dark. You're late again. Einstein said time was relative, right? Maybe I'm not late. Maybe you guys are early. Sorry. It was just so quiet. Would you like to keep standing there, or do you wanna sit down? Our universe is, in fact, one of many parallel universes happening at the exact same time. Thanks to everyone here at the Fisk Family Foundation... - I liked your joke. - Really? I mean, it wasn't funny. That's why I laughed. But it was smart, so I liked it. I don't think I've seen you before. Every choice that we make would create countless other possibilities. A what-if to infinity. A zero? A few more of those, you'd probably have to kick me outta here, huh? Maybe I'm just not right for this school. If a person wearing a blindfold picked the answers on a true-or-false quiz at random, do you know what score they would get? - 50%? - That's right! The only way to get all the answers wrong is to know which answers are right. You're trying to quit. And I'm not gonna let you. I'm assigning you a personal essay. Not about physics, but about you, and what kind of person you want to be. - Unh. Unh - Unh. Unh Come on Ha, sicker than Your average Poppa twist cabbage Off instinct Don't think My Detroit players, timbs for My hooligans in Brooklyn Dead right, if the head Right, Biggie there e'rynight Never lose, never choose to Bruise crews who - Do something to us... - Come on Uncle Aaron! Hey! Were you scared? You want that? What's up with school? Going great! Got tons of friends. You can't tell me it's all that bad there. Smart girls is where it's at. Place must be full of 'em. No, there's no one. Yo, I can't have no nephew of mine on the streets with no game. Hey, I got game. There's a new girl. Actually, you know, she's kinda into me. You know how it is. What's her name? You know, we layin' down the groundwork right now. You know about the shoulder touch? 'Course I do. But tell me anyway. Tomorrow, find that girl. You walk up to her and be like: "Hey." You serious, Uncle Aaron? I'm tellin' you, man, it's science. So walk up to her and be like: "Hey." No, no, no, no. Like: "Hey." "Hey." No. "Hey." "Hey." You sure you my nephew, man? Is that her? I should probably go. Still got a paper to do tonight. Yo, you been holdin' out on me? You throw these up yet? Naw, man. You know my dad. I can't. Come on. I got a spot you ain't gon' believe. Naw, I can't. I can't. Can't. I'm gonna get in so much trouble. Hey, man. Tell him your art teacher made you. How'd you know about this place? Did an engineering job down here. One, two, three Four, five... What's up? Yeah, man, I knew we were related. Whoa! Brooklyn! There's a lot of history on these walls. This is so fresh. And now you on your own, Miles. Whoa, slow down a little. That's better. Who's the black sheep? What's the black sheep? Don't know who I am When I'm coming so you sleep See what you got now? Makin' mistakes is part of it. And you can't beat that... The real Miles comin' outta hidin'. You gotta hay? It's for the hoes Now you can cut that line with another color. You can get with this Or you can get with that You can get with this or You can get with that You can get with this Or you can get with that I think you'll get with this For this is where it's at Little help? ...who was quite contrary Talkin' 'bout Mary... Did you want drips? 'Cause if you do, that's cool, but if you don't, you gotta keep it moving. That's intentional. - Wow. - Is it too crazy? No, man. Miles, I see exactly what you're doing there. Yeah. You know, me and your dad used to do this back in the day. - Stop lyin'. - It's true. Then he took on the cop thing, and I don't know... He's a good guy, just... You know what I'm sayin'. All right, come on, man. I gotta roll. ( Miles, let's go. That's weird. My pants shrank. I think I hit puberty. I gotta get new pants. Wait. Why is the voice in my head so loud? What? - Oh! Are you okay? - What? Why am I so sweaty? Why are you so sweaty? It's a puberty thing. I don't know why I said that. I'm not going through puberty. I did, but I'm done. I'm a man. So you're, like, new here, right? We got that in common. Yeah. That's one thing. Cool. Yeah. I'm Miles. I'm Gwe... anda. Wait, your name is Gwanda? Yes, it's African. I'm South African. No accent though 'cause I was raised here. Do the shoulder touch now before she walks away. Why is this so scary? Am I doing this in slow motion or does it just feel that way? I'm kidding. It's Wanda. No "G." That's crazy. Heh. Hey. Okay, then. I'll see you around. Oh. See you. - Sorry. Um... - Hey. - Oh, crap. - Can you let go, please? - I can't let go. - Ow! Ow! Calm down. It's fine. - Miles, let go. - Workin' on it. It's just puberty. I don't think you know what puberty is. Just relax. - Okay, I have a plan. - Great. - I'm gonna pull really hard. - That's a terrible plan. - One. - Don't do this. - Two. - Three! Nice to meet you? Sure. Total pleasure. No one saw. It's okay. No one knows, no one knows. Everyone knows. Everyone knows. They're talkin' 'bout me. They saw everything! He knows. She knows. They know. Wow, she's super tall. Why is he smiling? Am I the weird guy now? What am I doing? That guy's such a weirdo. How do I stop? Can they hear my thoughts?! Why are all my thoughts so loud?! Hey! I know you snuck out last night, Morales. Play dumb! Who's Morales? Not that dumb! Hey! Okay, okay. You're okay. You're okay. He'll never find you. No. Ow! What are you doing in my office, Morales?! Morales! Open up! Oh, Spider-bells Goblin smells Why is this happening? Spider-buggy blew a tire He's got a nice voice. Spidey-bells, Spidey-bells Open up! Stop sticking! Keep sticking, Miles! Oh! Hofstadter is suggesting... ...is that we... ...look on the... Okay. My room! "Why is this happening?" "Please stop sticking." "Please keep st..." Wait, wait, wait. How could there be two Spider-Men? There can't be two Spider-Men. Can there? Come on, Uncle Aaron, pick up. Pick up! Yo, it's Aaron. I'm outta town for a few days. I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace. No. No-No-No-No-No. It's not possible! It's just puberty. It's a normal spider and I'm a normal kid! All right! I gotta tell someone. Okay, you're being crazy, Miles. You're being crazy. Find the spider. You'll see. It's a normal spider. It's, like, boring how normal this spider is. I'm right here. Why is this happening to me? Slow down! What am I doing? Way over there. You're like me. Miles. Look out. I don't wanna be a hero. Miles. Whoa! Norman, listen to me. Spider-Man? I cannot let you open a portal to another dimension. Brooklyn is not zoned for that. It's not up to me. Is that Green Goblin?! Why won't you quit?! I guess I like Brooklyn not being sucked into a black hole. I think I'm gonna go. Staten Island, maybe. Not Brooklyn. No! No! Whoa! What now? What is this place? Did you know your shoes are untied? - Uh-huh. - This is a onesie, so I don't really have to worry about it. I thought I was the only one. You're like me. I don't wanna be. I don't think you have a choice, kiddo. Got a lot going through your head, I'm sure. Yeah. You're gonna be fine. I can help you. If you stick around, I can show you the ropes. Yeah. I just need to destroy this big machine real quick before the space-time continuum collapses. Don't move. See you in a bit. How does he do that? Is it here? No, no, it's here. All right, folks. I always get this wrong. Oh, boy. Prowler. Man, I was in the middle of something. I am so tired. Are you mad at me? I feel like you're mad at me. That all you got? Aw, so gross. I should go up there and help him. Who am I kidding? I should not do that. Watch out. Here comes the Spider-Man. You like my new toy? Cost me a fortune, but, hey, can't take it with you, right? You came all this way. Watch the test. It's a hell of a freaking light show. You're gonna love this. No! No, don't do this! Stop! You don't know what it can do! You'll kill us all! I see multiple dimensions opening! That was three, four and five separate dimensions. It's unstable! We should stop. Norm, what's your take on head trauma? I tried to warn you, pal. Goblin, no! Get him outta there! Wilson! Where are we? Really weird. Wilson! Hey! Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just resting. - Can't you get up? - Yeah. Yeah, I always get up. The coughing's probably not a good sign. Find him. Now. Listen, we gotta team up here. We don't have that much time. This override key is the only way to stop the collider. Swing up there, use this key, push the button and blow it up. You need to hide your face. You don't tell anyone who you are. No one can know. He's got everyone in his pocket. If he turns the machine on again, everything you know will disappear. Your family, everyone. Everyone. Promise me you'll do this. I promise. Go. Destroy the collider. I'll come and find you. It's gonna be okay. Tombstone. We're done with tests. Get that thing ready to go again. And soon. Run faster! These guys are weak. I'd say it's nice to see you again, Spider-Man, but it's not. Hey, Kingpin. How's business? Boomin'. Heh. Nice. Aw, that's a no-no. This might open a black hole under Brooklyn. It can't be worth the risk. It's not always about the money, Spider-Man. Don't you wanna know what I saw in there? Wait. I know what you're trying to do, and it won't work. They're gone. Get rid of the body. What was that? Kill that guy. Stop sticking! Stand clear of the closing doors, please. Yeah, I think it's a Banksy. Police! Put your hands up! Miles? Miles? Why aren't you at school? Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. It's okay. Miles? Qu te pasa? Is it the earthquake? Can I sleep here tonight? Miles. It's a weeknight. You made a commitment to that school. He's upset. Of course you can stay. - Dad? - Yeah. Do you really hate Spider-Man? Yeah. I mean, with a vigilante, there is... Jeff, mi amor. What? He asked me. Baby, you know how I feel about Spider-Man. Come on. T sabes que l te quiere mucho. That's why he's tough on you. You know that, right? Mom, do you ever think about moving out of Brooklyn? Our family doesn't run from things, Miles. Yeah, I know. What's that about? He's having a hard time, Jeff. When it gets hard, that's when he's gotta stick it out. We interrupt this broadcast for a special report. Sad news tonight. The hero known as Spider-Man has died after injuries related to another powerful earthquake in Brooklyn. Multiple sources are confirming that Peter Parker, a 26-year-old grad student and part-time photographer operated as Spider-Man for at least a decade. I'm not runnin' Runnin', runnin' No, I'm not afraid Of the fall I'm not scared... He is survived by his wife, Mary Jane, and his aunt, May Parker. Our hero, Spider-Man, is gone. I'm not scared... My husband, Peter Parker, was an ordinary person. He always said it could've been anyone behind the mask. He was just the kid who happened to get bit. I'm going to miss him. Yeah. We were friends, you know. Can I return it if it doesn't fit? It always fits eventually. He didn't ask for his powers, but he chose to be Spider-Man. My favorite thing about Peter is that he made us each feel powerful. We all have powers of one kind or another. Of the dark... But in our own way. We are all Spider-Man. And we're all counting on you. They're counting on me. Probably not you specifically. I think it's a metaphor. I'm sorry, Mr. Parker. That thing you gave me, that key I think I really messed it up. I wanna do what you asked. I really do. But I'm sorry. I'm not sure I'm the guy. I can't do this without you. Hey, kid. Whoa! What did I do to him?! No.
Miles: Who are you?
Peter B. Parker: Alright, people, let’s do this one last time. My name is Peter B. Parker. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for the last 22 years, I thought I was the one and only... Spider-Man. What a day. I'm pretty sure you know the rest. You see... I saved the city, fell in love, I got married, saved the city some more, maybe too much, my marriage got testy, made some dicey money choices, don’t invest in a Spider-themed restaurant. Then like 15 years passed, blah, blah, blah, super boring. I broke my back, a drone flew into my face, I buried Aunt May, my wife and I... split up. But I handled it like a champion. [crying in the shower] 'Cause you know what? No matter how many times I get hit, I always get back up, and I got a lot of time to reflect and work on myself. Did you know that seahorses that they mate for life? Could you imagine a seahorse seeing another seahorse and then making it work? She wanted kids… and it scared me. I'm pretty sure I broke her heart. Flash forward, I'm in my apartment doing push-ups, doing ab crunches, getting strong, when this weird thing happened. And I gotta say, weird things happen to me a lot. But this was real weird. You see, I was in New York, but the things were different. Also, I was dead… and blonde. I was kind of perfect. It was like looking in a mirror. (Well, in a... different way.) I have a feeling that the thing that brought me here, was the thing that got him killed. You wanna know what happened next? Me too.
Who are you? What are you doin' over there? Freeze! P.D.N.Y. Stop! Are you kidding me right now? Stop! Stop! I gotcha. I gotcha. Hey, kid. Drop the body. - Hey, kid. Get over here! - Come on, now! Whoa. See you, officers! Aw, come on. - Hey, kid. - Kid, come on, now! Put 'em up, son! Uh... adis? Help! Somebody stop that train! Oh, hey. What the...? Sorry. I'm gonna die! Looks like a child dressed like Spider-Man dragging a homeless corpse behind a train. Yes! I didn't kill you. - Who are you? - Who are you? Why are you trying to kill me? I'm not. I'm trying to save you. Hey, maybe you guys can go around? All right. Thanks, New York. What was that? Kid electrocuted me with his hands. - You're like me. - I got some questions. Why do you look like Peter Parker? Because I am Peter Parker. Then why aren't you dead? And why is your hair different? Why are you older? And why is your body a different shape? Pretty sure you just called me fat. You don't look so hot either, kid. Most superheroes don't wear their own merch. - Are you a ghost? - No. - Are you a zombie? - Stop it. - Am I a zombie? - You're not even close. Are you from another dimension? Like a parallel universe where things are like this universe but different? And you're Spider-Man in that universe? But somehow traveled to this universe, but you don't know how? Wow. That was really just a guess? We learned about it in physics. - Quantum theory. - This is amazing! You can teach me like Peter said he would. Before he died. - Yeah. Exactly. - Yeah, right. Look, I made a promise to him. Here's lesson number one, kid. Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands. Peter, seriously... Trust me, kid. This'll all make you a better Spider-Man. Hey, are you okay? No, I'm not. What's going on with your body? I don't think my atoms are real jazzed about being in the wrong dimension. Look, I'm not looking for a side gig as a Spider-Man coach. I got a lot going on in my dimension. "With great power comes great..." Don't you dare finish that sentence. Don't do it! I'm sick of it. Want my advice? Go back to being a regular kid. I don't have a choice! Kingpin's got a supercollider. He's tryin' to kill me. - What did you just say? - Kingpin's tryin' to kill me. Who cares about that. Where's the collider? Brooklyn. Under Fisk Tower. - Goodbye. - Where you going? When it runs again, I'll jump in - and get back to my life. - You can't let them run it. I'm supposed to destroy it so it never runs again or everyone's gonna die. "Or everyone's gonna die." That is what they always say. But there's always a little bit of time before everybody dies and that's when I do my best work. Aren't you gonna need this? Aw, you have a goober. Give it. Wait, no. Not so fast. He called it an override key. There's always a bypass key, a virus key, a who-cares key. I can never remember, so I always call it a goober. Give it. I need it to destroy the collider. I need it to go home. I'll swallow it. Don't play with me. - What? - I said... The collider created a portal that brought me here. And I have to get... - Did you break this? - No, it broke. I don't remember what happened. See, this is why I never had kids. Can't we make another one? We can't do anything. Thanks to you, I have to re-steal what your guy stole from Alchemax and make another one of these. If I don't turn off the collider after you leave, everyone in this city, my parents, my uncle and millions of others, will die. And you're just gonna go home and leave me here to figure this out for myself? - You good with that, Spider-Man? - Yeah. What are you doing? Making you feel guilty. Is it working? How could it...? No. Look at me. Does it look like it's working? No. No, it's not... No! No! No! Do not let him win! All right, kid. You win. Come on, we don't have a second to lose. Mmm. I love this burger. So delicious. One of the best burgers I've ever had. In my universe, this place closed six years ago. I don't know why. I really don't. Mmm. You have money, right? I'm not very liquid right now. - Can we focus? - Mm-hm. Sure. - The other Peter... - You gonna eat that? I'm listening. The other Peter said he was gonna be - showing me the ropes. - Wow. You got any Spider-Man tips you can tell me now? Yeah, I got plenty. Disinfect the mask. You're gonna wanna use baby powder in the suit, heavy on the joints. You don't want any chafing, right? - Anything else? - Nope, that was everything. I think you're gonna be a bad teacher. Uh-uh-uh? Look up where Alchemax is. "A private technological campus in Hudson Valley, New York." You can teach me to swing on the way there. I'm not swinging to the Hudson Valley, Miles. Not after a hearty burger breakfast. Keep your legs fresh. You're gonna thank me later. I can see a new horizon Underneath the blazing sky I'll be where the eagle's Flying higher... - And it's a no on the cape. - I think it's cool. Take that off. It's disrespectful. Spider-Man doesn't wear a cape. So how do we retrace Peter's steps? That's a good question. What would I do if I were me? Got it. Step One: I infiltrate the lab. Two: Find the head scientist's computer. That lady with the bike is the head scientist. I saw her in this documentary. Cool! Step Three: I reexamine my personal biases. Step Four: I hack the computer. It's not technically hacking. Not now. I just lost my train of thought. Step Five: Download the important stuff. I'll know it when I see it. Step Six: I grab a bagel from the cafeteria and run. So, what am I doing? Step Seven: You stay here. You're lookout. Very important. Look, man. You gotta teach me how to do Spider-Man stuff or I won't be able to help. Watch and learn, kid! I'll quiz ya later! Why did I get stuck with the janky, old, broke hobo Spider-Man?! That's new. Kingpin. What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? What am I doing? Whoa! Peter! Peter! Peter! - What are you doing here? - Kingpin's here. Just move over. You're steppin' on my foot. Go back outside. No! I can't sit there and let Spider-Man die without doing anything about it. I'm not doing that again. What? Most people I meet in the workplace try to kill me, so you're a nice change of pace. Mr. Fisk! Look at this data. I know you can't really understand it, but these are really good numbers. And I got the password. Mr. Fisk. If we fire again this week there could be a black hole under Brooklyn. You see this? And this? This is multiple dimensions beginning to crash into each other. This is pretty standard Spider-Man stakes. You get used to it. Watch this. He's gonna say, "You've got 24 hours." You've got 24 hours. What this means is there could be a rupture in the space-time continuum. Ooh. That's bad. Actually, everything she said was bad. I was lying before. Hold on. Let me get you some more data. - What are you doing, bud? - I can't move. Okay, relax your fingers. We don't have time. Just let go. Be in the moment. I am in the moment. It's a terrible moment. - I'm not refusing. - No more excuses. I just need more time. They're right there. They're gonna see you. Miles, you gotta unstick. What do you do to relax? Relax. Okay, okay, okay. Needless to say, I... Oh, for crying out loud. Callin' it quits Now, baby, I'm a wreck You're a wreck, ooh... Teenagers: just the worst. - Miles, where did you go? - I'm right here. - Where? I can't see ya. - I'm right in front of you. - Can Spider-Man turn invisible? - Not in my universe. Aah! You just poked me in my eye! This is incredible. Some kind of fight or flight thing. What's that? Remember this password. D-G-F-A-M-P-E-S-A-N-D... Slow down! -4-$-3-5-8-7-6-5-3-4-5-4-5-3-5. - I need to write it down! - Download the schematic. - How do I do that? - While I turn on the charm. Spider-Man? Oh, hey. Didn't see you there. Wow. Okay, I'm kinda freaking out right now. You're supposed to be dead. Surprise! Okay. That's a no-no. We don't like that. This is fascinating. Okay, that's my face. An entirely different Peter Parker. Little bit of a gut, perhaps from dimensional warping. Oh, yeah-yeah-yeah. I was way flatter before I warped. Travel through the multiverse appears to have deteriorated the... What was the rest?! Hey, how old are you? 'Cause you don't look a day over 35. They said I was crazy! They said I was crazy! You showed 'em you're not crazy. This might pinch a little. I know. I just need to get these samples. Okay. Organize your desktop, lady. Wow. Just complete cellular decay. I've never seen anything like this. What are you doing? I'm just taking the whole thing. And obviously you've been glitching. "Glitchin'"? No. Why would you even say that? If you stay in this dimension too long, your body's gonna disintegrate. Do you know how painful that would be, Peter Parker? I don't know. You can't imagine. And I, for one, can't wait to watch. What did you say your name was? Dr. Olivia Octavius. Can I assume that your friends call you Doc Ock? My friends actually call me Liv. My enemies call me Doc Ock. I got this! Run! Who are you talking to? - I got it! - Oh, you "got it," Peter? I got it handled, buddy! Everything is fine! Okay, this is - a little bit bad. - You're chatty. Gotta go. This is the moment that I'm losin' the fight. Let me tell you the good news. We don't need the monitor. Peter! You didn't tell me you had an invisible friend! Could you give me that back, young man? Peter! It's proprietary. Oh. This'd be a good time - to turn invisible. - Yep. Okay, not gonna turn invisible. Selecting a bagel. Act super normal. Spider-Man? You know, that's funny, - I get that a lot. - Hey. - Spider-Man? - Hey! Hands up! Now we do a switchy-switchy. Get back here! Where do you think you're going? - He took a bagel! - Time to swing, - just like I taught ya. - When did you teach me that? I didn't. It's a little joke for team-building. Hey! - All right, you ready? - Of course I'm not ready! I can't do this yet! Everybody knows that the best way to learn is under intense life-threatening pressure. Come on, come on, come on. Uh-oh. What are you doing down there? I run better than I swing. You gotta swing or they'll catch you. This is what you wanted. Uh-oh. Come back, little boy. Aim with your hips! Look where you want it to hit. Square your shoulders. Don't forget to follow through! Don't shoot off your back foot. - That's too many things! - Then stop listening to me! That's the best idea you've had all day! Nice, Miles! Good. You're doin' it. Double tap to release and thwip it out again. Thwip and release. - And thwip. Release. Thwip. - And release. You're a natural. Thwip. Release. - Feel the rhythm? - Thwip. And release! Good, Miles. I gotta say, you're amazing, man. We're a little team! Me as the teacher who could still do it. You as the student who can do it, just not as good. I'm proud of us. Is there something you want to say to me? Peter! - What the...? - Who did that? Hey, guys. Gwanda? It's Gwen, actually. Oh, you know her. Very cool. I'm from another dimension. I mean, another-another dimension. All right, people. Let's start at the beginning one last time. My name is Gwen Stacy. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for the last two years, I've been the one and only Spider-Woman. You guys know the rest. I joined a band. Saved my dad. I couldn't save my best friend, Peter Parker, so now I save everyone else. And I don't do friends anymore, just to avoid any distractions. And one day this weird thing happened. And I mean, like, really weird. I was blown into last week. Literally. I landed in New York, but not my New York. Lucky for these folks, Spider-Man was there to save the day. My Spider-sense told me to head to Visions Academy. ...you guys are early. Wasn't sure why until I met you. Oh! I like your haircut. You don't get to like my haircut. Let's go. How many more Spider-People are there? Save it for Comic-Con. What's Comic-Con? Whoa! You're dead, Spider-Man. Wilson! What are you doing? Vanessa. Richard, come on. Vanessa! Richard! No! Don't look back, honey. It's okay. It's okay. I killed Spider-Man. Why did I just see two more? There's three, actually. No, this is good. This is very, very good. This means you get what you want. It means my collider works. All we have to do is kill a couple of Spiders. And the collider will bring your family back. As many families as you want. Tomorrow, at my collider. Our collider. He broke this? Yeah. He's actually really embarrassed about it, so just keep it between us, okay? I know where we can make a new one. And we won't let him break it this time. I'm sorry about your friend. Thanks, Miles. I know how hard this is. To have to figure this stuff out on your own. It's kinda nice not being the only Spider-person around. Yeah. If you ever decide to do friends again, I could always open up a slot. I'll keep you posted. Cool. We should probably go. (Somewhere in Queens...)

Gwen: Peter, we're literally on the doorstep.
Bad idea. This is a bad idea. Just relax. You guys are all very sweet, but no more fans today, please. I'm not ready for this. Peter? Hey, Aunt May. So this is gonna sound crazy, but I'm pretty sure that I'm from an... An alternate dimension. Yeah. You look tired, Peter. Well, I am tired. - And older. And thicker. - Yeah. I've heard that already. Oh, jeez. Are those sweatpants? Yup, that's what they are. I was there, when it all happened. I am so sorry. And what dimension are you from? Brooklyn. Did Peter have a place where we could make another one of these? A goober. Follow me. Oh, yeah, I got one of these, too. A little, old shed where I keep my Spider-gear. I mean, this place is pretentious. Whoa. Dude. Was yours anything like this? Mine was like this, but take away the jeep, the plane. Imagine it way smaller. Imagine a futon. I feel sad for this guy. Hey, Peter. I think this is a cape. Peter knew how dangerous the job was. But he figured the only one who could stop this guy was Spider-Man. Kingpin knows we're coming. We're going to be outnumbered. Don't be so sure. You might need these. You think you're the only people who thought to come here? Hey, fellas. Is he in black and white? Where's that wind coming from? We're in a basement. Wherever I go, the wind follows. And the wind, it smells like rain. Hi, guys! This could literally not get any weirder. It can get weirder. I just washed my hands. That's why they're wet. No other reason. You're like me.

Noir Spider-Man: Sometimes I let matches burn down to my fingertips just to feel something, anything.
Spider-Ham: I'm a photographer for the Daily Beagle. When I'm not pooching around, I'm working like a dog, trying to sniff out the latest story. I frolic and I dance. And I do this with my pants-
Okay! Enough! So how did you get here? Well, it's kind of a long story. Maybe not that long. And now we're just trying to find a way home. The only way home is back through that collider gizmo. The only trouble is... One of us has to stay behind and destroy it. - I'll do it. - I'll do it. - I'll do it. No, no, no. You guys don't get it. Don't get what? None of you can stay here. If you stay here, you'll die. I'm the guy who's gonna turn it off. And I'm gonna get you all home before I do. Look, I made a promise. So I have to keep it. Who are you again? This is Miles. And he's gonna save the multiverse. Yeah, man. This kid can turn himself invisible. Watch this. He can do it now. - I can't do it on command. - He can't do it on command. But it is cool. Show 'em the zappy thing, Miles. - Can't do it on command. - He can't do it on command. But he can do so much more. What else do you do? - Just those two things. - Just those two things. Aw, man. Look, I've seen him in action. He's got potential. I think he's gonna get us home. Okay, little fella, Kingpin's gonna send a lot of mugs after ya. I'm talkin' hard boys, real biscuit boxers. Can you fight them all off at once? I haven't actually fought anyone. Surprise attack! Can you rewire a mainframe while being shot at? - Can I what? - Show me! Surprise attack! Can you swing and flip with the grace of a trained dancer? Can you close off your feelings so you don't get crippled by the moral ambiguity of your violent actions? Can you help your aunt create an online dating profile so she can get out of the dang house once in a while? Can you float through the air when you smell a delicious pie? - Can you be strong? - Ruthless? - Disciplined? - I don't know. Maybe. - Psychic? - Show me some moxie, soldier! Above all, no matter how many times you get hit, can you get back up? 'Cause when a Spider-Man is on the floor... When you think you can't keep goin'... - Come on, Miles. - Come on. You can do it. - You can do this. - Guys, cool it. - Come on. You can do it! - Get up, Miles. Come on, Miles. Get up. You need to be more honest with yourself about this. He's not ready. It's obvious. There's no way. He's just a kid. If he can't do this, we have to stay and do it for him. He's looking right at us while we talk about him. Miles? Miles? You see that? He can, um... He can turn invisible. When it gets dark Outside In you I confide You help me face my demons I won't hide... Miles, what is going on with you? Nobody's heard from you. We don't know what's going on. If you're hidin' something from us, you need to come clean. You call me back. Now. He's not answering me either. It's Aaron. I'm outta town for a few days. I'll hit you when I'm back. Peace. Aaron, it's Jeff. Look, I need you to call me if you've heard from Miles. He has a... He has a soft spot for you, and we haven't heard from him. And you know I wouldn't reach out if this wasn't important. Hope you're good. Dear Uncle Aaron. I gotta do something, and I don't know if I can do it. I'm scared, man. I'm just tired of lettin' everybody down. You're the only one I can talk to. I just wish you were here. Hello, Mr. Fisk. I've got the security tapes from the tunnel right here. If the kid's out there, I'll find him. You know me, sir. I don't ever quit. Personal insanity They gotta like the ally Turn it up Against the rally You're running in While they're counting Even score, got the tally Knock 'em off at the finale Go, go! They don't want it, yeah They don't want it, yeah This is... - Purple. - No. - Blue? - No. Has anyone heard from Miles? Look, he's just clearing his head. I know the kid. He's got what it takes. I bet you he's gonna come back through that door, recharged and ready to fight. - My uncle. - Hey, where have you been? My uncle Aaron, he's the Prowler. - Slow down, Miles. - He works for Kingpin. He tried to kill me! This is a pretty hard-core origin story. It's okay. We're gonna figure it out. - Were you followed? - No, I don't think so. - Cute place. Real homey. - Oh, great. It's Liv. I guess I was followed. Oh, no. Get out of here, kid. You messed up bigtime, kid. Very sloppy. Let me guess. You're Scorpion. Well, we're the Spider gang. Would you mind taking this outside? We don't pick the ballroom, we just dance. Ooh, I think I'll be taking that. Stand, niito, dale. Preprate a morir. Man, stupid pillows. I said, take it outside! I got it! I got this, buddy. Leave the kid alone! No, no, no! No! You gotta go, man. All vehicles in the area, we have a disturbance involving multiple Spiderpeople? Yeah. On my way. Give me that thing. Don't be stupid, kid. Hand it over, now! Nowhere left to run. Miles? Uncle Aaron. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Please, Uncle Aaron. Prowler. What are you waitin' for? Finish it. Get out of here! No. Miles. Uncle Aaron. This is my fault. No, Miles. I'm sorry. I wanted you to look up to me. I let you down, man. I let you down. You're the best of all of us, Miles. You're on your way. Just keep going. Just keep going. Hands up! Put your arms up. Now! Turn around. Hey! Hey! Aaron. Aaron, no. No! All units. I want an APB on a new Spider-Man. Hey, bud. You okay? We've all been there. You know, for me, it was my Uncle Ben. For me, it was my Uncle Benjamin. For me, it was my father. For me, it was my best friend. Miles, the hardest thing about this job is you can't always save everybody. Look, it was my fault. You wouldn't understand. Miles, we're probably the only ones who do understand. Oh, no. Who in here trying To start a riot? That way, that way. Other way, other way, other way, other way. Who that swinging In the air? Hey there. Do animals talk in this dimension? 'Cause I don't wanna freak him out. Let's stand up, stand up You better just fix your... What's going on? Bye, Miles. Miles, I came to say goodbye. We can say goodbye at the collider. You're not getting it. You're staying here. I need to be there. So you can all go home. They are going home, Miles. I'm the only one stayin'. You're taking my place? If you stay here, you'll die. I'm doing what needs to be done. I just wanted you to hear it from me. What about MJ? Not everything works out, kid. I need the goober. Please don't make me take it from you. That's not fair! You gotta tell them I can do this. It wasn't their decision. I gotta make Kingpin pay! You have to let me make him pay! Miles, you're gonna get yourself killed. But I'm ready. I promise! Then venom-strike me right now. Or turn invisible on command so you can get past me. Look, I know how much you want this, kid. Poor little guy. But you don't have it yet. I'm sorry. When will I know I'm ready? You won't. It's a leap of faith. That's all it is, Miles. A leap of faith. Miles. Miles, it's your dad. Please open the door. Miles, I can see your shadow movin' around. Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it. You're still ignoring me. Look, can we talk for a minute? Something... Something happened to... Look, sometimes people drift apart, Miles. And I don't want that to happen to us, okay? I know I don't always do what you need me to do or say what you need me to say. I see this spark in you. It's amazing. It's why I push you. But it's yours. Whatever you choose to do with it, you'll be great. Look, call me when you can. Okay? I love you. You don't have to say it back, though. 200 miles per hour With a blindfold on Mama always asking "Where did I go wrong?" Took you long enough. Ah, what's up, danger? I see this spark in you. It's amazing. Whatever you choose to do with it, you'll be great. Our family doesn't run from things. You're the best of all of us, Miles. You're on your way. Just keep going. When do I know I'm Spider-Man? You won't. That's all it is, Miles. A leap of faith. Like, what's up, danger? Like, what's up, danger? Like, what's up, danger? Like, what's up, danger? Made 'em myself. They fit perfectly. - Can't stop me now - Traveled 200 miles I'm knockin' at your door And I don't really care - If you ain't done wrong - I said I got you now Come on, what's up, danger? Don't be a stranger I'm right here at your door I won't leave, I want more What's up, danger? Yeah, what's up, danger? Can't stop me now 'Cause I like high G's Sister, I might lose I like it all on the edge Just like you, hey I like tall buildings So I can leap off of 'em I go hard with it No matter how dark it is Come on, what's up, danger? Kingpin has a private elevator entrance from his penthouse to the collider below. Didn't count on having an audience. You gotta be kidding me. Thank you. It's nice to be with you this evening to celebrate Spider-Man. He and I were very close. - What a pig. - I'm right here. Hold on. Get a load of how the waiters are dressed. It's in poor taste, but... It can't be that easy. It's that easy. I just wanna thank Mary Jane Parker for being here this evening. MJ? Pay attention. It's not your MJ, Peter, okay? I'm sorry, I'll be right back. Peter! Come here. Trust me. I've been there. You gotta move on, buddy. It will take one second. Let me just... Oh! - Hello. - Oh, wow. Um... I just wondered if we could have some more bread at table 12. Yeah. I'm just... I'm really sorry. Oh! Don't be sorry. It's just bread. I wasn't there for you when you needed me. - Mm-hmm. - I didn't even try. That's fine. You know, I should really get going. I know I could do better if I just had another chance to give you the bread that you deserve. Are you okay? We'll take care of that bread right now. Well, it's been nice talking to you. For you, they should fill this place up with fresh bread. - You all right, man? - Oh, yeah. Totally. Good, 'cause we are not getting any bread. I'm just sorry my family can't see what we're doing here tonight. Initializing primary ignition sequence. Sleep. Start the sequence. Uploading Vanessa Fisk and Richard Fisk DNA sequence. Beginning scan for dimensional matches. Secondary ignition in five, four, three, two, one. Peter, you don't have to stay behind. I can do it. It's okay. I've made up my mind. I'll put the goober in and take over the beam. After you're gone, I'll blow it up. Good luck, guys. They know we're here. Nice to see you again, Peter. I got you covered! These guys are the pits. Why is this always difficult? Where you going, Peter? Any last words? Can I get a minute to think about it? You have a pen? Goodbye, Peter Parker. Who did that?! - Miles? - Spider-Man? Wow, Miles. You're doing it on command! It's about time, right? - Look who's here! - You figured it out. I love you! I am so proud of you! Do I want kids? Oh, yeah, I forgot about her. Well, that doesn't look promising. No, it doesn't. I've got genetic matches. Hold on. It's too risky. Shut up and turn it up. - On your left! - On your right! I got five o'clock! Three o'clock! Two o'clock! Every direction! Get to a shelter. I'll be right there. I tried the school, but I can't get through. Guys, are you seeing this? Looks like our dimensions are coming to us. Does look cool though, right? We gotta get back up there. Is that all you got? You gonna fight or you just bumping gums? You hard-boiled turtle slapper! What are you, some kind of silly cartoon? You got a problem with cartoons? Blammo! Aww... Did that feel like a cartoon? Gwen! I like your suit. Thanks. I made it myself. That was adorable, team! Now, hold on tight! Buckle up, guys. This is gonna take a while. All right. Never mind. Let's end this thing. Guys, I got it. I'll go. I'm the one with the goo... Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Don't watch the mouth. Watch the hands. - Miles! - Be careful! That was crazy. We taught him that, right? I didn't teach him that. And you definitely didn't. You okay? Come on. Guys, I got control of the beam! Get up here! Alert! Quantum polarity has been reversed. Guess this is it. Well, nice to know we're not alone. - Right? - Yeah. I got the portal open. You first, Peni. Thank you, Miles. From both of us. I, uh, love you all. I'm taking this cube thing with me. I don't understand it. But I will. I want you to have this. It'll fit in your pocket. That's all, folks. Is he allowed to say that, legally? Do I get to like the hairdo now? You know I'm older than you. 15 months, but it's pretty significant if you ask me. Well, Einstein said time was relative, right? Nice. Friends? Friends. Cool. See you around, Spider-Man. Your turn. Yeah, yeah. Right. You're not going anywhere! I'll hold him off. You shut this down. Peter, that wasn't the deal! Push the green button! Do not wait for me! - What are you doing? - You gotta go home! This guy could kill you! I can't let Spider-Man die. Neither can I. It's okay. Yeah, it is okay. You gotta go home, man. How do I know I'm not gonna mess it up again? You won't. Right. It's a leap of faith. Not bad, kid. Kingpin! Nope! Sorry! That's cheating. Adis. I gotta get to that button. Oh, no. Not so easy doing it on your own, is it? I can't wait to kill one more Spider-Man. - Where am I? - What? Wilson? - Is this what you want, man? - What are you doing? Vanessa. Vanessa. - What are we doing here? - I don't know, Richard. It's me. You know me. We're leaving now. Don't go. Stay with me. Please! You're not stopping this. Not today. I am stopping this. Right now! I need backup. Come on. The real Spider-Man couldn't even beat me. You're nothing! You took my family. And now I'm gonna make sure you never see yours again. Get up, Spider-Man. Get up! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. I'll always have my family. You ever hear of the shoulder touch? What? Hey. Hey, Kingpin! Push the green button for me! Miles? Miles? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. You're probably busy... No! I can talk, I can talk. Look, so I came by earlier because... - Your uncle... - I know, Dad. I am so sorry. Yeah. Do you know who did it? I thought I did. But I was wrong. Look, Miles, what I said at the door, it wasn't just talk. Look, you know, I was thinking maybe we could find a nice wall, privately owned, like at the police station, and you could "throw up" some of your art. Man, I'm bad at this. Okay, Miles. Miles? You there? Oh, come on, man. C-Mobile! - Officer. - Spider-Man! Listen, down there, that was... I mean, I owe you... Okay! I look forward to workin' with you. Yeah, me, too. I guess. I don't approve of your methods, but we're just gonna have to agree to disagree. Thank you for your bravery tonight. I love you. Wait, what? And look behind you! All right. Cool. Yeah. Thanks, Spider-Man. Spider-Man, a su servicio. Thank you. Hey, man. What's up, little man? New Spider-Man. Yeah. Yeah, I'm the new Spider-Man. Check it out. Whoa! That was part of the move. Okay, let's do this one last time, yeah? For real this time. This is it. My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. And for like two days, I've been the one and only Spider-Man. I think you know the rest. I finished my essay. Saved a bunch of people. Got hit by a drone. I did this with my dad. Met my roommate. Finally. Slapped a sticker where my dad's never gonna find it. And when I feel alone, like no one understands what I'm going through, I remember my friends who get it. I never thought I'd be able to do any of this stuff. But I can. Anyone can wear the mask. You could wear the mask. If you didn't know that before, I hope you do now. 'Cause I'm Spider-Man. And I'm not the only one. Not by a long shot. Needless to say I keep her in check She was all bad-bad Nevertheless Callin' it quits now Baby, I'm a wreck... Miles. Miles! You got a minute?

[Post-credit scene - a caption reads "Meanwhile, in Nueva York..." and a hologram woman appears in a darkly-lit spacious hallway]
Lyla: You're a bit late.
Miguel O'Hara: [off-screen] Can't all be everywhere at once.
Lyla: A little text might have been nice.
Miguel: I was gone for less than two hours. What happened?
Lyla: Okay, okay, okay. I know what it looks like, but... here's the good news.
Miguel: Oh, here we go.
Lyla: The multiverse didn't collapse.
Miguel: Oh, cool!
Lyla: A little touch and go. It worked out.
Miguel: Great story. Hey, did you finish the goober?
Lyla: It's not a goober. It's a gizmo.
Miguel: You always have to call me out? It's just really frustrating and that bums me out.
Lyla: Don't get too excited, Miguel. It's just a prototype.
Miguel: Not excited.
Lyla: But you could be the first person to make an autonomous multiverse jump, or the last.
Miguel: Okay, so we're just... gonna roll the dice on this?
Lyla: So what do you say, pal? Where do you want to go first?
Miguel: Let's start at the beginning, one last time. Earth-67.
[Miguel jumps into Earth-67 and meets that universe's Spider-Man]
Miguel: Whoa!
1967 Spider-Man: What the–?
Miguel: I'm Spider-Man. I need you to come with me.
'67 Spider-Man: [pointing at Miguel] Who the heck are you?
Miguel: [pointing back] I, I just told you. Now listen, listen. I'm from the future.
'67 Spider-Man: [pointing back] How dare you point at me.
Miguel: [pointing back] You, you were pointing first.
'67 Spider-Man: [pointing back] It's rude to point.
Miguel: [pointing back] You're being very rude! You're not even believing what I'm saying!
[scene focuses on J. Jonah Jameson and a NYPD officer]
Police officer: Which one pointed first?
J. Jonah Jameson: Spider-Man pointed first. Obviously!
Miguel: [as both Spider-Men continue to point at each other] You're pointing at me right now! Look at you! Look what you did there! Look at your finger right now!
'67 Spider-Man: It's different than normal pointing.
Miguel: You are pointing...
'67 Spider-Man: You haven't seen pointing until I'm through with you.
Miguel: You're accusing me of pointing... what are you...

Let’s do things differently this time. Like, so differently. His name is Miles Morales. He was bitten by a radioactive spider. And he’s not the only one. He hasn’t always had it easy. And he’s not the only one. And now he's on his own. You think you know the rest; you don’t. I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't. I didn’t want to hurt him, but I did.

Glory Grant: Hey!

MJ Watson: Yo, Def Leppard!

Betty Brant: Gwen!

Screen text: Chelsea, NY Earth-65 (*Spider-Gwen’s World)

Gwen: Is the song over? Seems over.

Glory Grant: Are you okay? You don't hang out, and you don't wanna talk.

Gwen: I didn’t join a band so I could talk about my feelings.

Betty Brant: Well, I did.

Gwen: I joined it so I could hit my feelings with sticks.

Glory Grant: Yo, if you don't tell someone what's going on, you're gonna snap-

Gwen: I’m fine!

MJ Watson: That's not how someone who's fine would say that.

Glory Grant: You say, "I’m great, thanks. How are you?"

Gwen: I’m great!

Glory Grant: Whoa!

Gwen: Thanks! How are you?

Betty Brant: Fine...?

Glory Grant: Gwen, come on.

MJ Watson: I don't get you, man.

Gwen: You're right!

Betty Brant: I play drums.

Gwen (narrating with “Self Love” by Metro Boomin and Coi Leray playing): I always wanted to be in a band. Guess I just never found the right one. In this line of work, you always wind up a solo act. Before Miles, there was Peter.

Gwen: What the... How many did you take?

Peter: I think they look great. I don't know.

Gwen: Is this that dangerous menace?

Peter: No, no no. She seems like a good guy.

George: Why wear a mask if you’ve got nothing to hide?

May: Alright, no politics at the dinner table.

Gwen: Hmm, thank you, May.

Gwen (narrating): But they didn't really know me, and I didn't really know him either.

[Peter grunts]

Gwen: Touch him again, Ned!

Peter: Gwen, it's okay.

Gwen (narrating): Until it was too late.

[woman:] Hey Gwen.

Gwen: Hey.

Gwen: Peter?

[snarling]

[crashes]

Gwen: What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! What did you do?

Peter: I just... wanted to be special, like you... Gwen.  

Gwen: Gwen?  

Peter: Don't worry.

Gwen: Who's Gwen?!  

Peter: Everything's gonna be okay.  

Gwen: Don't...  

Peter: Everything's gonna be...

Gwen: Don't go! Oh, Peter...  

George: Hey, hey! [gun cocks] HEY! Peter?

Gwen (narrating): I never really made another friend after that, except one. But he's not here. And there's no way to get there.

J. Jonah Jameson: Pressure mounts as Captain George Stacy leads the manhunt for Spider-Woman. Who is she? And why won't she show her face? Peter Parker, an innocent young man...  

George: I've known May and Ben Parker for 12 years. Peter Parker ate at my table. He was my daughter's best friend. And I will not rest until I find this Spider-Woman.

George: Oh, hey, hey, hey. How's the band?

Gwen: Uh... uh, yeah, great. I quit so, you know...

George: You did, huh? Okay.

Gwen: ...thumbs up.

George (with Gwen's theme): We, uh... we caught a break in the Spider-Woman case.  

Gwen: Oh, that's good.  

George: We're close, I'm tellin' ya, I can feel it.  

Gwen: Me too.  

George: It'll be good for us.  

Gwen: Don't be so sure.  

George: She killed your friend.  

Gwen: You don't know that.  

George: What do you mean I don't know that? I do know that. I was there. She ran from the scene.  

Gwen: Maybe she didn't have a choice.  

George: I got a job to do, Gwen.  

Gwen: It won't bring him back.  

George: Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?  

Gwen: Yeah, I can tell.  

George: Say, uh... too punk rock to give your old man a hug- Oh...

Radio Cop #1: All units, possible superhuman event, Guggenheim Museum. Suspect is Adrian Toomes, also known as the Vulture.  

George: Oh, hey, this could be it. So, I uh, see you later?  

Gwen: (whispers) Cool.

George: Uh, I-I'll call later. Love you!

Radio Cop #2: 49-20 on scene. We're going to need all the help we can get. It's a real mess down here.

Radio Cop #1: This is Captain Stacy, I’m five out, I need you to look alive. Good chance our girl shows up.

George: Yuri, explain to me how a guy with a 40-foot wingspan just waltzed into the Guggenheim unnoticed?  

Yuri: Hey, it's New York. Everyone's got their thing.  

The Vulture: Arrivaderci! (Goodbye!)

George: Do you know what he wants?  

Yuri: Do you speak Italian?

 George: Uh, I'm an Irish cop.

Yuri: Maybe you love pasta or something.  

George: Everybody on my signal. Look out for signs of Spider-Woman. Hey!  

Yuri: Looks like we got our sign.

Gwen: (in a lower voice) How's the manhunt for me going?

George: (mumbles) You're under arrest!  

Gwen: (in a lower voice) Good to know.  

Gwen: Vulture! ...huh. Screaming their name usually works...  

Gwen (music starts playing): Well, I guess that worked.  

The Vulture: I am the Vulture, the pinnacle of man's genius!  

Gwen: You're not my Vulture. What are you made of, parchment?  

The Vulture: What cursed world have you brought me to? (glitches out)  

Gwen: Glitching, huh? Been there. Uh, where are you from, bud?

 The Vulture: I am an artist, an engineer.  

Gwen: Oh, great, a Renaissance man.

The Vulture: Yes.  

Gwen: Ooh, let me guess. You were having an espresso in some old-timey, Leonardo da Vinci dimension, then suddenly a portal opened up, and you wound up here. Am I wrong?

 The Vulture: Yes, that's pretty much it.  

Gwen: Sidebar, uh, maybe you could you stop making a mess in the art museum for no reason?  

The Vulture: You call this art?  

Gwen: We're talking about it, aren't we?  

Museum-Goer #1: Ooh, that's cool.  

Gwen: Well, I mean, it's more of a meta commentary on what we call art, but it's also art. Oh, look, it's your cousin.  

The Vulture: (Squawks)  

Gwen: I wouldn't play with fire, dude, you're kind of made of paper!  

The Vulture: Ciao, ragazza. (Bye, girl.)

 Gwen: Oh no.

The Vulture (with Miguel's theme playing shortly after): Che cosa… (What the…)

Gwen: I'm sorry, who exactly are you supposed to be?

Miguel: …that's classified.

Gwen: You're...the Blue Panther?

Miguel: No.

Gwen: The Cape Crusader?

Miguel: No, I'm...

Gwen: Dark Garfield?

Miguel: No-- stop.

Gwen: Macho Libre?

Miguel: I'm from another dimension.

Gwen: You are?! Woooooow! Actually, I'm not confused.

Miguel: My name… is Miguel O'Hara. I lead an elite strike force dedicated to the security of the multiverse--

Gwen: Actually, forget about it. Can you go to any dimension you want with that watch thing?

Miguel: It's...much cooler than a watch.

Gwen: Okay, sensitive... Look, there is a big flying turkey from the Renaissance. I have to bring the justice, so if you don't mind...

Miguel: It's alright, kid.

Gwen: Wow.

Miguel: I'll take it from here.

Gwen: Okay, knock yourself out.

Miguel: Wh- Why are you saying it like that- agh! You're not funny!

Gwen: Hmm, I don't know. (laughs)

Miguel: It's been really fun cleaning up your shocking mess, by the way!

Gwen: What mess?

Miguel: Kingpin's collider!

The Vulture: What are you guys talking about?

Gwen: (None of your business, nosey.)

Miguel: (You shut up! ¡Cállate!)

Gwen: We saved the multiverse.

Miguel: You left a hole wide enough for guys like him to randomly get shot into the wrong dimension. Now I'm stuck putting everybody back where they belong before all of time and space collapses! And don't even get me started on Doctor Strange and the little nerd back on Earth-199999!

Gwen: Who's Doctor Strange? Sounds like he maybe shouldn't practice medicine. (in a lower voice) Sorry, Captain, can't talk right now.

George: Hey, hey!

Gwen: I'll be back. So, you want me to handle this one, or... huh, okay.

Miguel: Ay, por dios, he's got hammerspace. Lyla, can you please...you know?

Lyla: Nah, you gotta say it first.

Miguel: Call for backup...

Lyla: What?

Miguel: Call for backup.

Lyla: Come on.

Miguel: PLEASE, just call for...

Lyla: Yeah, I already called her.

Miguel: D'AH!

Lyla: But I enjoyed that.

Jessica: Spider-Woman

Gwen: Me too. um, are you..?

Jessica: Oh, this? We dont know the sex yet. My husband wants it to be a surprise… he's really corny, but so hot!

Gwen: Will you adopt me?

Jessica: What?

Gwen: Wh-What?

Miguel: Guys! Can we focus on the big fire-breathing threat to time and space, please?

Jessica: Yup. Yup, yup yup yup yup-

Gwen: Right.

Jessica: What about her?

Miguel: No.

Jessica: We could use the help--

Miguel: No.

Jessica: Is it 'cause she called you Dark Garfield?

Miguel: No.

Jessica: Do you say anything other than "no"?

Miguel: No... YES!

Jessica: Why not?

Miguel: You know why not.

The Vulture: Enough of this! Take a good look at the Greek Fire from my backpack.

Miguel: Don't let him out! He'll disrupt the canon!

The Vulture: Wha?!

The Vulture: Che meravigliosa bellezza… (What a wonderful beauty…)

Police Loudspeaker: Go to the ground!

Miguel: Would you get out of here?!

Police Loudspeaker: We have you surrounded!

Miguel: I'm a good guy!

Police Loudspeaker: You don't look like a good guy.

Miguel: You're going to have to shut up and trust me- NO!

Museum-Goer #2: Yeah, I think it's a Banksy.

Miguel: That's what I was going to do.

George: Hands in the air!

Gwen: Captain, come on-

George: Suspect is armed.

Gwen: With what? I'm-I'm out of web!

George: Get down on the ground!

Gwen: Which is it, hands in the air or get down on the ground?

George: You're under arrest.

Gwen: I just saved a bunch of people!

George: For the murder of Peter Parker.

Gwen: Captain, come on, I--

George: You have the remain silent. (Anything you say--)

Gwen: (You don't understand.)

George: You don't understand.

Gwen: Dad, I'm... I've thought about telling you, but you can see why I didn't want to. You can see why I didn't tell you. I didn't murder Peter. I didn't... I didn't know it was him. I didn't have a choice!

George: How long have you been lying to me?

Gwen: Can you just... Can you just not be a cop for a second and be my dad and just listen to me? Do you really think I'm a murderer? You're in this to help people, right? Right?? So am I, and the way to help right now is to listen to me, please, Dad, you're all I have left.

George: You have the right to remain silent. (Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney--)

Gwen: (Uh-what? Dad, are you really this afraid of me? No, stop!)

George: Don't get any closer! What?

Gwen: Dad!

Jessica: Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Just breathe. We got you, right, Miguel?

Miguel: Lyla, scan this mess.

Lyla: No further anomalies. Canon remains intact.

Jessica: We can't just leave her here. She's doing this on her own.

Gwen: I don't know how to fix this.

Miguel: Yeah… Well, join the club.

Rio: I know he just a sophomore but we want to get a jump collage competition so I'm sure he's gonna be… here any minute.

Jefferson: He's very serious about his future.

The Spot: 'Scuse me, do you have, uh, an ATM Machine?

Lenny: Yeah, a-- around here in the back

The Spot: Preferably not chained to the wall...?

Lenny: Wh-What?

The Spot: Uh, nothing! This should be simple enough. Just make a hole, grab the money... Oh, that's not right. Just give-- Ugh, gimme your money! Where are you, money, where are you? C'mere--! Wait--!

Businessman: Hey, who left this ATM on the sidewalk?!

Lenny: Yo! What you doing' back there, man?

The Spot: Nothing! Nothing! Everything is-- Everything's cool, man! 'S all good! Just forgot my PIN Number!

Lenny: Get yourself out of here!

The Spot: AH! NO! Sir, please just let me rob you!

Lenny: I’m going to rob your little spotted face!

The Spot: Whoa! There's no reason to bring wood into this! I've never robbed anyone before, please don't make this a bad experience for me!

Lenny: Bad experience?! I'm trying to run a business here!

The Spot: I HAVE THIS WHOLE-- Oh, wow, is this curry powder? Well, see, I'm a scientist. Or, I was-- I am. [Spot is stumbling clumsily while dodging the Store Owner's attacks with a bat.]

Lenny: Get out of here!

The Spot: Anyway, you heard of Alchemax? I used to-- I used to work there. I was actually considered handsome by scientist standards. I had a little accident! AAH! Now look at me! I'm so sorry! First of all, I'm not even robbing you, I mean, this ATM Machine doesn't even belong to you, right? This belongs to the bank! They're the real criminals!

Lenny: You're the real criminal! You're robbing me!

The Spot: Y'know, I can't really get a job anywhere anymore, being like this, so I've turned to a life of crime, (I'm having trouble finding a-- Huh?!)

Miles Morales (entering in scene upside down while holding a beef patty): Why do people say 'ATM Machine'?

The Spot (bewildered): Who said that?

Miles (smiling jokingly): The 'M' stands for 'Machine'.

The Spot: Spider-Man! AUGH! Woah, OW. Ugh that really hurt.

Miles: Hey Lenny, how much do I owe you for this beef patty, man?

Lenny: Spidey, if you catch him, it's on the house brother!

The Spot: Ow, oh Spider-Man wow, ahh, this is real!

Miles: So, are you like a cow or a Dalmatian?

The Spot: I am... The Spot.

Miles: (Laughs)

The Spot: We meet again Spider-Man. Oh that's funny to you?

Miles: Of course not, no, is that a costume?

The Spot: Unfortunately for both of us this is skin...

Miles: Oh, dang.

The Spot: You see, I'm from your past. One year ago-

Miles: Hold up.

The Spot: Oh, COME ON!

Miles: Uh oh. (Well this has been fun, um, but I really gotta wrap this up.)

The Spot: (Who you talking to? No no no no no no, go ahead take the call-- AHH!)

Miles: This job, is so dumb sometimes. (mumbling)

Lenny: [unimpressed] Maybe just pay me now...

Miles (Narrating): Okay, let's do this one last time. My name is Miles Morales. I was bitten by a radioactive spider, and for the last year and four months, I've been Brooklyn's one and only Spider-Man, and things are going great...

Miles: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

The Spot: Woo!

Miles: You can hurt somebody.

Miles (Narrating): Catching all sorts of bad guys.

Miles: See ya! Hahaha! Oh! Can you just act like a regular supervillain so I can catch you?

Miles (Narrating): I designed my new suit with some fly ambiance down the side. Aunt May moved to Florida. I just hosted Jeopardy, endorsed baby powder, apologized for endorsing baby powder...

Miles (Video): "I made a mistake."

Miles (Narrating): My mustache came in...

Slowed down Voice: Mustache

Miles (Narrating): ... and out...

Miles (Video): "I made another mistake."

Miles (Narrating): I've been developing a brand new twist on my venom thing.

Miles (Flashback): Woah, woah, woah... sorry.

Miles (Narrating): How much longer can I keep lying about who I really am?

Rio: I hear that new Spider-Man is Puerto Rican.

Miles: Ah-ha, nah, he seems more Dominican to me.

Miles (Narrating): I mean, would they get it if I told them?

Rio and Jefferson (At the same time): We love you and accept you even though you have been lying to us for a year!

Miles (Narrating): Maybe in some other universe. Sometimes I just... wish I wasn't the only one. I don't dwell on it. I miss my uncle sometimes...  

Uncle Aaron: Miles, I see exactly what you're doing here.

Miles (Narrating): ... Even though he turned out to be the Prowler. I've been trying to do what he told me.  

Uncle Aaron / The Prowler (muffled) and Miles: Just keep going.

The Spot: You're looking at your texts? You understand this is the fight of our lives, right?

Miles: Sorry, sorry, just - just a second man... one second.

The Spot: Oh okay, no no no no no, go ahead, take one call, turning off your phone in a movie theater but you don't turn it off when you're fighting me?!

Jefferson: Ah, inaminit, ayyyy, he wrote it all as one word that's cute, right? The youth...!

The Spot: Argh, my nose!

Miles: Sorry, I just really got to be somewher-

The Spot: Psych.

Jefferson: Heh, there's bubbles now, hold on.

Miles: Woah!

The Spot: I think this is going great.

Jefferson: Still bubbles on here, you know I think it's probably okay.

The Spot: We're figuring it out- (gurgling)

The Spot: I've been waiting for this moment for a really long time, so, AH, hey, what the - where'd the goose come from? Woah!

Male Kid: I don't think I want this costume anymore...

Miles: Almost there, Mami, smiley face, prayer.

The Spot: Hey, is this your goose- woah!

Goose: Honk!

Miles (Narrating): At the end of the day...

The Spot: I got you right where I - Ow! So aggressive!

Miles (Narrating): I'm Spider-Man. No one can take that away from me.

The Spot: Unbelievable. Come back here, nemesis!

Miles: Don't escape!

The Spot: Your costume's too tight in the back, by the way. [Miles swings into his dorm room, where Ganke is lounging in a white tank top and boxers, playing Marvel's Spider-Man 2 for the PS5. The following conversation takes place as Miles dresses up in his civilian wear.]

Miles: Yo, wassup man?  

Ganke: I'm writing an essay.

Miles: There's a bad guy on the roof of the Peterson building, can you call the police, tell them to pick him up?

Ganke: I dunno, sounds like a slippery slope...

Miles: Just this one time?

Ganke: It starts with one call, then it's walkie talkies and synchronized watches. In a month it'll be a Spider Signal. [Miles walks out of his dorm, closing the door behind him.]

Ganke: [muffled] I'm not your guy in the chair! [Miles reopens the door.]

Miles: Are those my Jordans? [Ganke is indeed wearing Miles's Jordans.]

Ganke: I can't help it if we're the same size! [A web thwips to the Jordans from offscreen, and Ganke is pulled towards the camera.]

Counselor: You see, every person is a universe, and my job is to capture your person's universe on this piece of paper.

Jefferson: That's blank.

Counselor: Exactly. I have no idea who this kid is. I don't know if he knows and he's gotta decide, if he is going to commit himself to his future, or whatever he's doing instead of being here, can't have your cake and eat it, too.

Miles: Unless you bake two cakes.

Jefferson and Rio (At the same time): Miles.

Counselor: Interest in comedy...

Miles: How's this going, college, whoowhoo!

Jefferson: Now son, what did we always say?

Jefferson and Rio (at the same time): On time (is 5 MINUTES EARLY)!

Miles: (- is 5 minutes early), I know, I know, I know, look, I gotta get back to being a great student, so can we make this quick?

Rio: (Glances and stops slouching)

Jefferson: (Glances, straighter)

Counselor: Okay. Miles' grades are pretty good, A in AP physics.

Rio: That's my little man.

Counselor: And AP studio art.

Jefferson: Heh heh, he takes after his uncle.

Counselor: A minus in English.  

Rio: She's a tough grader!

Counselor: And a B in Spanish.

Rio: WHAT?!  

Jefferson: Wooo! Okay… Are you trying to kill your mot-

Rio: Miles, *snaps her fingers* ma nito, Es Cómo decima?

Miles: Cálmate, mami, eso no es my fault!

Rio: [missing] clase en Spanglish?

Miles: Mom, i just missing a few classes.

Jefferson: Oh, just a few classes. Well, what's "a few"?

Miles: I mean, you know, like... five?

Jefferson and Rio (at the same time): Five?!

Counselor: Actually six.  

Rio: You're dead.

Miles: Mom...

Jefferson: A truant.

Miles: Wait wait wait, wait, but...

Jefferson: [sighs] Takes after his uncle.

Miles: But I-I just have a lot going on.

Counselor: Alright, we can still salvage this.

Jefferson: Wait, I'm sorry, "salvage"?

Counselor: Miles has great story to tell.

Miles: Having a story at all seems gross.

Counselor: Your name is Miles Morales.

Miles: Correct...

Counselor: You grew up in a struggling immigrant family.

Rio: I'm from Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is part of America?

Jefferson: We own a floor in Brooklyn, I-I-I I... uh... Struggling? [muttering] I don't know what you're talking about.

Counselor: It doesn't matter. You're all struggling.

Jefferson: I make captain next week.

Counselor: And now his dream is to attend the top physics program in the nation...

Rio: Whatever it takes, we'll do it.

Counselor: ...at Princeton University.

Rio: In New Jersey? No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no that's too far!

Miles: New Jersey is too far from New York?!

Rio: There's great schools in Brooklyn!

Miles: Princeton has the quantum researchers in the country.

Jefferson: Quantum re- mmhmm.

Miles: They're moving electrons across dimensional thresholds!

Jefferson: Dimension thresholds.

Miles: I mean they're studying dark matter!

Jefferson: Yeah I don't know what that means. Miles: I could help figure out how to travel across other dimensions.

Rio: Yeah, okay. Jefferson: Yeah, okay, that sounds like a really good fake job.

Miles: Dad when you were my age, you followed your dreams and went out on your own, to start a business with Uncle Aaron, right?

Jefferson: That's... different, we use to... see when you were born, plus your mom use to... look life is a journey,

Miles: You all got me into this school because you thought I could do something special and now I think so too, and the special thing I wanna do is this. there are people out there, who can literally teach me the things I wanna learn, but they aren't all in Brooklyn.

Counselor: That's your story, now just stick to the script...

The spot: Woo! Aagh.  

Miles (internal): Are you kidding me!

Miles: Oooh! I got to go, you you guys keep talking this is all good stuff!

Rio: Miles, wait! Did you order the cakes for tonight?

Miles: Totally I'm, call me-uh I gotta go! Alright bye!

Rio: This kid, I swear what are we going to do with him.

Walkie Talkie: All units, superhuman event in progress...

Jefferson: I gotta go, too.

Rio: He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves, why-why... why am I here?!

Jefferson: I know, I'm sorry. We'll figure this out, together.

Rio: Wow. Excuse me, I'm sooo sorry.

Counselor: He's lying to you.

Rio: Jeff?

Counselor: You son. He's lying and I think you know it...

Miles: How's your essay?

Ganke: Marinating, it's part of my process.

Miles: Oh-oh, really?

Ganke: I think your guy got away.

Miles: Thanks, I'm on it.

Ganke: Yikes, you seem really stress.

Miles: I agree.

Ganke: You're streched too thin.

Miles: Yeah, alright, thanks for the tip-ahh!

Rio: What was that?

Jefferson: Yeah I don't know.

Rio: What is really going on with this kid?

Jefferson: I don't know! Hey spider-man!

Miles: Officer Morales! I'm means (deepen voice) Officer Morales.

The Spot: This is not what it looks like.

Jefferson: Hey! Heeey! My kid goes here man! I'm on the PTA, you know how many lemon bars I got to make for that!

The Spot: You left in the middle of the fight!

Miles: I did not!

Jefferson: Are you serious?!

The Spot: It was inconsiderate and super rude... and a little cocky too!

Jefferson: Yeah, you got me agreeing with the bad guy right now.

Miles: Bad guy? He's barely a villain of the week!

The Spot: What you called me? You realize I'm right here, after everything?

Jefferson: Come on man-Ahh!

Miles (underwater): Under control.

The Spot: Of course we end up back here.

Jefferson: And you know what, your just like my son.

Miles: I am? (changes voices) I... haha that's so silly why haha (deepens voice) imagine that...

The Spot: Back where it all started.

Miles: NO!

The Spot: The crucible of our connection.

Miles: Hey don't try to wow me with big words, I do the crossword everyday.

The Spot: Is it all coming back to you?

Miles: What are you talking about?

The Spot: The creation event.

Miles: What?

Jefferson: Yeah?

Rio: I think I got cut off, [unintelligible] nothing is more important than family.

Jefferson: Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of something.

The Spot: Destiny called us here, you see now don't you?

Miles: I really don't.

The Spot: I am your nemesis.

Miles: You're not my nemesis.

The Spot: You missed. you can't contain The Spot-OW! You really don't remember what you did to me? What I did for you?

Miles: Uh, no.

The Spot: I worked at Alchemax, I ran a test on this collider that brought a spider here from another dimension.

Olivia (flasback): Fourty-two.

The Spot: It escaped and it bit you, my spider made you spider-man.

Miles: What?

The Spot: You ran through the cafeteria, you hit me with a bagel!

Miles: I've hit a lot different villains with a lot of different foods.

The Spot: You make your filppy, sassy little sassy jokes and everyone loves them, but no one knows what it feels like to be on the other side of 'em.

Miles: I'm just trying to lighten the mode, y'know.

The Spot: I created you and you created me.

[Jefferson looks at Miles in absolute disbelief]

Jefferson: Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?!

Miles: I didn't, he's talking crazy!

The Spot: I was in that collider when you blew it up! Because of you, I lost my job, my life, my face, my family wont even look at me, I made you into a hero, you made me into this, look at me, you did this to me, Look at me! I'll make you respect me! Ow! I am your nemesis!

Jefferson: Well-what? Where'd he go?

Miles: He kicked his own butt.

Jefferson: You know we are suppose to catch the bad guys, right?

Miles: I always do, usually.

Jefferson: Gutiérrez! Get the crane. Ugh, this is way nobody likes us, man.

Miles: Us?

Jefferson: I am trying, to do right out there.

Miles: I mean I'm trying too.

Jefferson: And you need to be a better role model.

Miles: I'm a great role model!

Jefferson: Hey, Gutiérrez, you can cancel the crane. I swear-[unintelligble]

Miles: Uh, do you want to talk about it?

Jefferson: Ar-are you crazy?!

Miles: Well, men of your generation ignore there mental health too long.

Jefferson: Oh boy. Why am! Why do I, do anything cause no matter what I do someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

Miles: I know the feeling. So, your son, how's he doing? Do you do you think he is going to figure it all out?

Jefferson: Honestly...

Miles: Yeah?

Jefferson: Honestly he's a good kid, It's scary cause he say these things that are so smart.

Miles: Cool, well, I should probably-

Jefferson: And he does these things that are so stupid. I just don't want him to mess it up.

Miles: Maybe get off the kid's a-

Jefferson: I'm sorry what?

Miles: What! What? I just-I don't know.

Jefferson: And I hate he is not being honest with me.

Miles: Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

Jefferson: Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?!

Miles: I-I-I don't know.

Jefferson: It just, you think you getting pretty good at being a parent, you got it lit and then they go and grow up. I just don't want to lose him, you know?

Miles: Well, as an objective observer with no skin in the game, I say, you gotta let him spread his wings man, like this.

Jefferson: Yeah, I know.

Miles: If this isn't nice, what is... I should go.

Jefferson: Hey, and catch that holes guy.

Miles: Don't worry I don't think that guy going to be showing his face again.

Spot: What? Okay... I think I kicked myself... Into myself. Well this is new. Hellooo! Hello! Echo, echo, echo -- no echo. Hypothesis. I'm going to put my head in that hole. Hello!

Old timey newsprint comic lady: *screaming and hitting spot with her purse*

Spot: Ow! OW, ow, ow! Stop it, stop it, stop it! That was... Cool! My holes can take me anywhere.  

Screen text: Chinatown, SF - EARTH-688  

Spot: Excuse me! Hi. Sorry to bug you, I know you're busy, sorry.  

Mrs. Chen: What do YOU want?

Spot: I know it's weird, I just came out of nowhere, but I think I'm becoming a trans-dimensional super being.

Mrs. Chen: So?

Spot: So? I’m literally splitting the fabric of space and time! For you it’s just a Tuesday night. You're acting like weird stuff like this happens to you all the time.

Mrs. Chen: *Gives a visibly unimpressed look*

Spot: Can I have some gum? Ahhh, woah!*falls back into portal*

Spot: The power of the multiverse, in the palm of my hand. *shouting triumphantly* My holes aren't a curse! They're the answer!

Distant construction worker: Can you stop talking about your holes?! You're making everyone uncomfortable over here!

Spot: No, no, no! You're gonna love this. Look, look, look. Hnrgghhh. I'm outta spots. Wouldn't ya know it? Uhhh, as you were gentlemen. I'm coming for you, Spider-Man!          

Jefferson: THAT’S THREE MONTHS!

Miles: Wait, wait, wait, hold on. There’s an elite society with all the best Spider-people in it?

Gwen: Okay, so there’s this lady — Jess Drew.

Miles: Uh-huh.

Gwen: She rides motorcycles. Oh my gosh, I’m learning so much from her.

Miles: Oh, yeah. I-I’ve learned a lot of new stuff, too. I’ve leveled up my whole thing. See? (Quickly imitates Gwen dangling from a web rope by her ankles)

Gwen: Oh, yeah? Let’s see it then.

Miles: Let’s go!

Gwen: Thread the needle!

[Gwen and Miles swing through a tight crevasse between two busses before Gwen leaps through an active intersection]

Miles: (Notices himself heading straight towards a truck in oncoming traffic) Woah!  

Miles: AHHHHHH!  

Miles: (Regains control after dodging the truck) Easy!

Gwen: And Miguel. The whole thing was his idea.

Miles: And… who’s Miguel?

Gwen: Oh, he’s like a… ninja, vampire, Spider-man, but a good guy?

Miles: A vampire good guy? I’d pay good money to see that. So how long ago did they invite you?

Gwen: Eh… only like a few months ago. You and me... It's--

Miles: We're the same... (Gwen looks at him) In the important ways, y'know?

Gwen: In every other universe, Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man… and in every other… universe, it doesn’t end well…

Miles: Well... There's a first time for everything, right?

Gwen: Oh wow. Feelings make me hungry.

Miles: Oh yea. These platanos are just deep fried feeling.

Rio: She looks old enough to vote. I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

Jefferson: Spanish...

Miles: This keeps you glitching in other dimensions?

Gwen: Yea. It's pretty cool.

Miles: What is it going to take for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

Gwen: I'll put in a good word.

Miles: I'm just saying. If I had a watch. I could come with you.

Gwen: Miles... Look...

Miles: I did save the multiverse.

Gwen: Its a really small, elite strike force...

Miles: I can turn invisible.  

Pavitr: Hey, Gwen! Who’s the new guy?

Gwen: Hi, Pav. He's miles and he wasn't invited

Pavitr: Ohohoho~, you weren't invited and you came anyway?!

Gwen: Right?!

Pavitr: Hey, new guy must be in love with you~.

Gwen: Woah, okay, no.

Miles: l'm not.

Pavitr: Oh, I'm very good at reading people.

Gwen: No, he’s not.

Miles: Who are you?

Pavitr: I'm glad you asked, new guy!

Miles: I am not a new guy!

Pavitr: My name is Pavitr Prabhakar and for the past six months-...!

Miles: Six months?! And even he got a watch?!

Gwen: Yeah, uh...

Pavitr: Being Spider-Man is so easy!

Pavitr (Narrating): I wake up, skip the work out because I’m naturally buff and I don’t want to get too big you know, do practically nothing with my amazing hair-...!

Miles: You don’t use any product in it at all?

Pavitr: Mmh, coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.

Pavitr (Narrating): Then I go to school—don’t really have to try, but I do anyway—, fight a few bad guys, feed a few street dogs. Quick break for a cup of chai with my auntie.

Miles: I love chai tea!

Pavitr: What did you just say...? “Chai tea“? Chai means tea, bro. You’re saying “tea, tea.“ Would I ask you for a “coffee, coffee” with room for “cream, cream“?

Miles: No, no. I’m sorry. So sorry.

Pavitr (Narrating): Then I hang out with my girlfriend, Gayatri~! She is an extremely classy teenager.

Pavitr: Hey, girl. So tonight I was thinking-... Hello police inspector, Singh! This is your daughter, I do not know her. And to top it all off, I live in the best possible Spiderman city: Mumbattan. Quick tour! This is where the traffic is. This is where the traffic is. This is also where the traffic is. There’s traffic here too. And this is where the British stole all of our stuff, Aaagh!

Miles: What’s this…?

Miguel O'Hara: This… is everything.

[The circle falls down, and begins to create itself into a tree, reminiscent of the TVA's "worldline".]

Miles: Can you… be more specific?

Miguel O’Hara: Can you… not talk? For a second?

Miles: Yeah- yeah yeah…

[A WEB PATTERN emerges.]

Miguel O’Hara: This here? This is all of us. All of our lives woven together… in a beautiful web of life and destiny…

Miles: The Spider Verse…

Miguel O’ Hara: Spider Verse? Huh, that’s… stupid. It’s called The Arachno-Humanoid-Poly-Multiverse. (off Miles’ look) Which sounds… stupid too I guess.

[Miles’s SPIDER-SENSE triggers at the sight of several rather important looking POINTS:]

Miles: And these nodes where the lines converge…?

Miguel O'Hara: They are the canon. Chapters that are a part of every spider’s story every time. Some good. Some bad. ...Some, very bad.

[Pan to a line of Spiders leaning over their guardians. Land on stock footage of "Into the Spider-Verse", Miles staying vigil over Uncle Aaron in the alleyway.]

Aaron Davis: Just keep going...

Miles: Uncle Aaron...

[Miguel gestures to a node behind him, showing a classic comics moment from "Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1" -- where CAPTAIN GEORGE STACY saves a RED-SHIRTED CHILD from FALLING RUBBLE, only to be crushed himself...]

Miguel: This one, Event ASM 90? A Police Captain close to Spider-Man dies saving a kid from falling rubble during battle with an arch-nemesis.

[In front of it -- a holographic render of the Spectacular Spider-Man (Josh Keaton) cradling his universe's George Stacy.]

Spectacular Spider-Man: Captain Stacy? I'm so sorry!

[Miles looks over to Gwen, who looks back wordlessly. His eyes then trail down the line of death before stopping to rest on a live-action scene: AMAZING SPIDER-MAN (Andrew Garfield) breaking down over the fallen Captain Stacy (Denis Leary).]

Amazing Spider-Man No...

[We see this moment echoed across many other spider- stories including Peter B.’s...]

Miles: Did that happen to you...?

[Peter's eyes say it all.]

Jessica Drew: And me.

[Miles looks over to Hobie.]

Hobie Brown: Eh. What of it?

Miguel: That's how the story's supposed to go.

[Hobie, Peter B., Jessica, and Gwen stare up at screens depicting different Canon Events -- "Spider-Man, No More", "If This Be My Destiny...!", Peter and M.J.'s wedding, a panel from the Spider-Gwen comic.]

Miguel: Canon Events are the connections that bind our lives together. And those connections can be broken. That's why Anomalies are so dangerous.

[The web shows Mumbattan: Inspector Singh runs to save a kid from falling rubble... and survives. Because Miles saved him.]

Miguel: Inspector Singh's death was a Canon Event. You weren't supposed to be there and you weren't supposed to save him. That's why Gwen tried to stop you.

[We watch Gwen grab Miles before he rescued Singh...]

Gwen: (past) Miles!

Miles: I thought you were trying to save me...

Gwen: I was, I... I was doing both.

Miguel: And now, Miles, because you changed the story, Pavitr's dimension is unravelling.

[Spider-S.W.A.T. try to contain the quantum breach.]

Miguel: If we're lucky, we can stop it. We haven't always been lucky.

Miles: That-- That wasn't me. That was the Spot!

Miguel: It's what happens when you break the Canon.

Miles: How do you know?

Miguel: Because I broke it once myself.

[We watch an ALTERNATE VERSION OF MIGUEL play with his daughter, GABRI. He is killed saving a woman from a thief.]

Miguel: I found another world where I had a family. Where I was happy -- at least, a version of me was. And that version of myself was killed. So I replaced him.

[A brief flashback to the event in question. Miguel seeking out this Earth, comic panel style animation depicting Earth's Miguel trying to stop a mugger, getting shot and dying... "Our" Miguel taking his place. Back on the recording of our Miguel with his new family. Past Miguel's smiling face overlays Present Miguel, switching off to reveal Present's morose expression.]

Miguel: I thought it was harmless. But I was wrong.

[Further holograms show the dimension collapsing -- the whole city glitching out, the Spider Society trying -- and failing -- to save the citizens. Miguel, in costume, runs through the street, his daughter in his arms.]

Miguel's Daughter: Daddy? Dad! Please, help!

[Miguel's daughter disappears in his arms. The camera pulls back to reveal Peter B standing next to him.]

Miguel: Isn't that right, Peter?

[Cut to B. in the present.]

Peter B.: Yeah...

[The destruction plays out in full, sending holographic shards towards Miles.]

Miguel: You break enough Canon, you save enough Captains... And we could lose everything.

[The holographic webs shatter and disintegrate around Miles. The teen breathes heavily. Pauses.]

Miles: ...My Dad is about to be Captain...

The Spot: I'm gonna take everything from you, like you took everything from me...

Child: Help!

Jefferson: I'm coming!

Miles: Spot does it. He kills him... When does it happen?

[No one wants to say it.]

Miles: When does it happen?!

Miguel: In two days. When he's sworn in.

LYLA: That's what the model says.

Miguel: I'm sorry, Miles.

Miles: Send me home!

Miguel: I can't do that. Not now.

Miles: What am I supposed to do, just let him die?!

[Miguel stands, unwavering.]

Miles: (turning to Gwen) What about your dad? He’s a Captain, right?

Gwen: Yeah.

Miles: And that's it? You just aren’t gonna do anything about it?

[Gwen can’t find any words.]

Miles: Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

[Miles looks over Peter, who looks at him wordlessly]

Miles: Would that have been okay if you knew, and you just… let it play out?!

Peter B.: If not for Uncle Ben, most of us wouldn’t be here, Miles.

[Peter B. leads Miles over to another hologram, depicting Uncle Ben's death from various media -- "The Amazing Spider-Man 2" tie-in video game, the flashback in "The Spectacular Spider-Man" (S1, E12), the original comic... But the most prominent figures are split into two: Peter 2 (Tobey Maguire), rage filled, looking off into the distance as his Ben (Cliff Robertson) bleeds out on the pavement.]

Peter B.: And all the good that we did, it… it wouldn’t have been done.  

Miles: So we’re just supposed to let people die, because some ALGORITHM…

Lyla: (shocked) Woah, woah!

Miles: ...says that that’s supposed to happen?! You realize how messed up that sounds right?

Miguel: You have a choice between saving one person, and saving an entire world. Every world.

Miles: I can do both! Spider-Man always-

Peter B. Parker: Not “always”…

Miguel: (sincere) Miles, we all want to live the life we wish we had -- believe me, I have tried. And the harder I tried, the more damage I did. You can't have it all, kid.

[A phalanx of Spiders surround Miles. More than we realized.]

Miguel: Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice. That's the job. That's what you signed up for.

Peni Parker: Miles...

[A mech walks up, opening its cockpit to reveal Peni Parker, teary-eyed.]

Miles: Peni...? What is this? Is this an intervention or something?!

[Looks that way.]

[SPECTACULAR SPIDER-MAN steps up:]

Spectacular: We know it's hard. But it's the truth, Miles.

Miles: (to Peter B.) Is that why you are here? To let me down easy?

[Peter B. opens his mouth, then closes it, despondent. Miles continues:]

Miles: It worked last time, why not run it back, huh?

Peter B. Parker: Hey, hold on, hold on--

Miles: You were right, Gwen. You should've never come to see me.

Peter B. Parker: Kid, look at me--

Miles: Stop calling me that.

Hobie: There we go.

Jessica: Hobie, you're not helping.

Hobie: Good.

Peter B.: Miles, please understand--

Miles: You can’t ask me not to save my father.

Miguel: I’m not asking.

[Miguel drops a CONTAINMENT FIELD around Miles. The same kind we’ve seen caging other anomalies...]

Gwen: Stop that!

[Miles fruitlessly wails against the cell’s ENERGY FIELD.]

Miguel: We let him leave, he'll only do more damage, you both know that!

Gwen: Miguel, that's enough!

Hobie: (whispered to Miles) Hey, Peter Pan.

[Hobie wiggles his fingers at Miles and mouths “Palms.”]

Miguel: (walking away) We just need to hold you a few days! (cold as hell) Sorry it had to end like this, kid...

Miles: (while absorbing the laser cage's energy) I said not to call me that!

[Miles let’s out a big venom shockwave that knocks out not only the cage he was in, but the whole Spider Society near him at the same time, as Hobie chuckles a tiny bit. Everything then becomes silent for a few seconds, Miles processes what he just did, until the music starts to become intense, which is where Miles begins to run.]

Miguel: MILES! (angry and running on all fours)

Peter B.: (preparing himself for the chase, taking Mayday with him) Alright. Sorry we’re doing this… this is bad parenting…

Hobie: Just for the record I quit. (He takes the watch off and leaves through a portal.)

[A Spider-Alarm begins to go off, which starts making all the Spider People question what’s going on.]

Miguel: All stations, drop what you’re doing, and stop Spider-Man!

[This leads to confusion between the Spider People and then they all start pointing at each other wondering which Spider-Man they’re supposed to stop.]

Miguel: Ay, coño, MILES! Miles Morales! He’s entering Sector Four!

[The Spider People then look at the person entering Sector Four.]

Max Borne (Spider-Man 2211): (confused) Do I uh… have web on my face? What’s the deal?

Miguel: MILES! He’s right there! He’s right—— TURN AROUND! (running)

Max Borne (Spider-Man 2211): I don’t see anything boss…

[Max Borne turns around, revealing that Miles is glued to his back. All the Spider People look at Miles, but not in a good way.]

Miles: (laughing nervously) Heh heh… heh…      

     

Miles: You.. you all knew?

Gwen: I.. I didn't know... how to tell you.

Miles: That's why you never came to see me.

Gwen: Miles it's for your own good.

Miles: Who decides that?! I'm not a kid Gwen!

Miguel: That's EXACTLY what you are… You're just a kid, who has NO… IDEA… WHAT HE’S DOING!!!

Miles: Yeah well… I did lure hundreds of Spider-People away from your little clubhouse.

Miguel: What?

Peter B. (To Gwen): I guess he did plan this out.

Miles: And I'm about to do this.

[Miles clutches Miguel's shoulders and charges up his toxic strike.]

Miles: Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go. Nah. Imma do my own thing. Sorry man, I'm going home.  

George: Wanna go easy on the penguin?

[Gwen goes to leave.]

INT. STACY RESIDENCE - NIGHT
[Gwen peeks out her door and finds George asleep on the couch.]

[There’s a lot she’d rather not have to say, that she’d rather not have to hear. So she grabs that picture of her and Miles - - it’s on the coffee table in front of him -- and leaves --]

[She’s halfway out the window when she senses George behind her, holding something--]

[She WHIPS around and webs his weapon to the wall. Only -- it’s not a weapon, is it? It’s... a stuffed penguin. The one she keeps her police scanner in.]

George: Wanna go easy on the penguin?

[She’s not laughing. Turns to leave...]

George: Just-- Will you just...? Are you even gonna look at me?

[She stares at him. Petulant. Silly almost.]

George: What? Wh-- What is that?

Gwen: I'm looking at you. Like you asked.

[George sighs. She takes off her mask.]

Gwen: You look skinny.

George: Where have you been?

Gwen: Just been, uh, out murdering all my friends.

George: Oh. Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay, yeah. Okay.

[Now he turns and leaves. Gwen follows; now she’s the trying to keep him from walking out the door. Who’s the kid here?]

Gwen: Where are you going?

George: I don't know!

[Maybe they both are.]

[Fer crackin’ ice somebody say something.]

Gwen: You're a good cop, Dad. Y'know, you put on that badge because you know if you don't, someone who shouldn't will. But... you have to understand, this mask is my badge! And I'm trying to be good, too. I was trying so hard to wear this thing the way you'd want! And I didn't! I didn't!

[He’s stopped in the doorway. Wheels turning.]

[She drops her mask.]

Gwen: I can do all these things, but I can't help the people I love the most, and they can only know half of who I am, so I-- I'm completely on my own! And now, I don't-- I don't even know what the right thing is anymore! I don't know what I'm supposed to do! But I know...! I can't lose one more friend.

George: Gwen... I always taught you to do it by the book.

Gwen: Yeah, and how did that work out?

George: I took an oath--

Gwen: Then arrest me, Dad! Get it over with.

George: I... I can't!

Gwen: Why not?

George: Because I quit.

Gwen: When?

George: About halfway through your big speech.

[She looks up...]

Gwen: You're...? Waitaminute, you're not-- You're not gonna be Captain? That means...

George: My job, being Captain, this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.

[It’s so simple, really.]

George: You're the best thing I've ever done.

[What else do you need?]

[Gwen thwips him towards her for a BIG HUG. He embraces all of her as she digs her face into this big lovable galoot...]

Gwen: (joking through tears) It was a good speech, huh?

George: No wonder you got an A in English.

Gwen: B. I got a B+. Missed a few classes.

[George walks over to the bookshelf.]

George: I don't know what it is you gotta do... But I-- I think that this thing is supposed to help.

[The box is multicolored. Punk, with the Union Jack emblazoned in one of the corners.]

George: The guy that left it was a real piece of work.

[Gwen pulls an object out of it -- a sticky note is attached, reading "In case it don't work out -- Hobie." She pulls it off, revealing a bootleg version of the watch, set for Earth 1610.]

[Gwen fiddles with the watch... WOMP. A WILD PORTAL overtakes the room. Poor George.]

Gwen: I'll be right back. I promise.

[She pulls down her mask and with a big WOMP she disappears into the portal. After she’s gone:]

George: Parenting... It's a big-ass mystery.  

Prowler: Your dad is still alive?

Miles: What?

Prowler: Your father. You said he's still alive.

Miles: Yeah.

Prowler: Huh.

Miles: Who are you?

Prowler: I'm Miles Morales. But you... You can call me the Prowler.

Miles: If I don't get home... our dad is going to die.

Miles (E-42): Your dad.

Miles: Please... You have to let me go.

Miles (E-42): Why would I do that?

Deleted Scenes
Miguel Calling
Miles: Okay, look: The target's name is The Spot. I know how he works, I know what makes him tick.

Miguel: What makes him tick?

Miles: No one takes him seriously.  

Miguel: Mm-hm.

Miles: Luckily, I faced him and won!

Miguel: [chuckles] Then why is he still at large?

Miles: Well, you see, I... My parents, I-- I had to go to this meeting with a college counselor. But, but not... Look, I'm-- I'm ready to give it my full attention, okay?

Miguel: Oh, wow, okay. Thank you! We're all full up.

Miles: Gwen, can... Can you help?

Gwen: I mean, he's a good kid. [Off Miles' look:] A great man.

Miguel: Kid, this whole situation's already too complicated.

Miles: 'Cuz, what? Let me guess: There's a multiverse and a bunch of timelines and if something different happens, it messes everything up, right? [Miguel stays focused on his task.]

Miles: I'm not an idiot! I read comics and watch TV and see movies. [Miguel sighs, finally turning towards Miles.]

Miguel: Why do you wanna be a part of this so badly?

Miles: Uh... justice!

Jessica Drew: Did he really just say that?

Miguel: Wrong answer.

Miles: Then what's the right answer? Tell me and I'll want that!

Miguel: You don't belong out there, kid.

Miles: But I could if you taught me to; I'm just as much a Spider-Man as you are.

Miguel: I couldn't.

Miles: Then show me! I used to have someone to show me the ropes. But now, I-- I don't have anyone. C'mon, man, please...

Miguel: We know where to find you.

Gwen: Miguel, please--

Miguel: Okay, Gwen? Do your job, or go home.

Gwen: Look, I--

Miles: Yeah, okay. I get it.

Gwen: I don't have a choice.

Miles: Me, either.

Gwen: It was nice meeting your parents. What you guys have is better than all this, anyway.

Miles: That's what people say when they don't get to do all that.

Gwen: Please. Let it go. I'll see you soon?

Miles: You bet.
